# critical values and rejection regions and confidence intervals

## random variable basics

a random variable can be thought of as a mathematical object which takes certain values with certain probabilities.

there are **discrete** and **continuous** random variables, but we can always find an approximate continuous one with a discrete one.

a simple discrete random variable $X$ can be described as a single random draw from a "box" containing tickets, each with numbers written on them.

- $E(X) = \mu$
- $Var(X) = \sigma^2$
- $SD(X) = \sigma$
